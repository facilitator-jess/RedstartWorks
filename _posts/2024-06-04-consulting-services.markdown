I’m a facilitator, project manager, evaluator, and strategic consultant. I can help you design or execute your next project. <br><br>
_Total cost varies based on the needs of your project._ Please [contact me](mailto:redstart.works@gmail.com) to schedule a 30-minute meeting and get a quote!

Digital Archiving and Preservation
-----------

Archivists are futurists. We are always thinking about how to preserve new formats and cultural formations, so we develop theories, think about model policies, and experiment with new practices sometimes far before they are ready to be implemented. The context around the data that archivists are committed to preserving encourages us to look at data input, data capture, and systems migration projects with a holistic and long-term view. If you’re embarking on a data management, information, or preservation project, [invite me to help](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03935-1): I’ll provide guidance based on a decade of first-hand experience in digital archives, and connect you with the latest community resources, best practices, and guidelines.

Evaluation and User Testing
-----------

I can serve as your [external grant evaluator](https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/evaluation-resources). My evaluation method often includes a combination of surveys/questionnaires, test/assessments, document review, interviews/focus groups, observation, and secondary source review.

I can also [design and execute a user test](https://osf.io/mrw9a/) of a project or program resource. Where are your pain points and how might they be alleviated? I can diagnose and recommend a path forward, sharing resources, case studies, and professional connections that meet your needs.

Management
-----------
Few management consulting firms provide services that match the needs of libraries and archives. Work with me to design your next program transformation, strategic plan, or to refresh your budgeting workflows.

Strategic Planning
-----------
I can facilitate your team or organization through a strategic planning or program transformation process. Everyone’s role in the process will be clear, and the discussions will follow a gentle ramp to ensure that we bring as many people along as possible. (Thank you to AORTA for [articulating this consensus method in a way that really stuck](https://aorta.coop/fundamentals-materials)!)

Budget Development
-----------
Looking to refresh your budgeting process? I’ll review your workflow and recommend ways to make it more transparent, participatory, and values-aligned. My experience comes from both managing organizational budgets and participating in my local government’s budgeting processes.

Research and Writing
-----------
I write and research on a variety of library-related topics. Here are some themes of my past publications and projects. <br>

* Born-digital archival collections practices
* Providing access to born-digital archives
* Ethics and values in library and particularly born-digital archival work
* Abolitionist reimaginings of archival practice
* Labor and staffing issues in US archives
* Facilitating and inspiring groups toward collective action

Advocacy
-------
A community organizer for over a decade, I’ve learned a lot about how to shape the world into what we want it to be for the next generation. I’ve led coordinated, multi-candidate local election campaigns that resulted in big wins. I’ve advocated for both vast resources and small comforts within the workplace. I’m a skilled lobbyist. Do you need help strategizing or executing advocacy campaigns that support libraries, archives, the commons, and/or open infrastructure? Please reach out!
