I’m a facilitator, trainer, and educator. I can help you train your workforce. [Get in touch](mailto:redstart.works@gmail.com) to work with me!

Training
--------
Library and archives projects require [radical collaboration](https://publications.arl.org/rli296/). Inclusion and engagement requires building intentional spaces. I can train your community, grant team, professional association, or whole organization to become greater collaborators and leaders. We will co-design your training to your organization’s needs and resources.

### Facilitation
This 2-hour interactive workshop covers topics like building intentionally inclusive meeting spaces, using different facilitation methods, and building consensus and moving to action.

This is a broad overview geared toward information professionals. For a deeper dive on oppression and how to fight it through facilitation, I recommend the [Anti-Oppression Resource & Training Alliance’s](https://aorta.coop/) training series.

_Starts at $1,000_

### Team Leadership

This 90-minute workshop covers topics like project management, communication methods, how to delegate, and how to split up work.
