You're invited to a virtual joint business meeting and annual program of the Society of American Archivists' Committee on Public Policy (COPP) and the Issues & Advocacy (I&A) Section on July 24th, from 11-12:30PM (CT) (12-1:30pm EST/9-10:30am PST).

The meeting will begin with a 30-minute business session, where we will discuss key updates and initiatives for COPP (15 mins) and I&A (15 mins). Following this, the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC)](https://workerorganizing.org/) will facilitate a 60-minute workshop on how to organize and build power with your coworkers. The process of joining a union can be murky -- so join this discussion to learn more about the first basic steps you can take with your coworkers to get started!
